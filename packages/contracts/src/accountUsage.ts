//
// The account-side mirror of the local profile stats: per-minute counters
// keyed by every dimension the local dashboard can attribute — provider,
// model, reasoning effort, and (separately) skill runs — with NO content.
// No prompts, no diffs, no titles, no trace of what was said ever travels;
// a bucket is a key and a handful of monotonically grown counters.
//
// Buckets carry ABSOLUTE values, not increments. A minute-bucket for one
// environment has exactly one writer (that environment's server), which
// recomputes the bucket locally and re-pushes it as it grows. The service
// upserts (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`), so re-pushing a bucket — a retry after
// a network failure, or the same minute growing across two pushes — is
// idempotent where an increment API would double-count.

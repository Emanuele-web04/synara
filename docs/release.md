# Release Checklist

This document covers how to run desktop releases from one tag, including the current unsigned macOS release path.

## What the workflow does

- Trigger: push tag matching `v*.*.*`.
- Runs quality gates first: lint, typecheck, test.
- Builds four artifacts in parallel:
  - macOS `arm64` DMG
  - macOS `x64` DMG
  - Linux `x64` AppImage
  - Windows `x64` NSIS installer
- Publishes one GitHub Release with all produced files.
  - Versions with a suffix after `X.Y.Z` (for example `1.2.3-alpha.1`) are published as GitHub prereleases.
  - Only plain `X.Y.Z` releases are marked as the repository's latest release.
- Includes Electron auto-update metadata (for example `latest*.yml` and `*.blockmap`) in release assets.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `t3`) with OIDC trusted publishing.
- macOS signing is enabled when Apple signing/notarization secrets are present. Without those secrets, the workflow intentionally publishes unsigned macOS artifacts.
- Windows signing is enabled when Azure Trusted Signing secrets are present.

## Desktop auto-update notes

- Runtime updater: `electron-updater` in `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`.
- Update UX:
  - Background checks run on startup delay + interval.
  - New updates are prepared/downloaded in the background after detection; install/restart stays manual.
  - The desktop UI shows a rocket update button while preparing and switches to an install action once the update is ready.
- Provider: GitHub Releases (`provider: github`) configured at build time.
- Repository slug source:
  - `T3CODE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` (format `owner/repo`), if set.
  - otherwise `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` from GitHub Actions.
- Required release assets for updater:
  - platform installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, plus macOS `.zip` for Squirrel.Mac update payloads)
  - `latest*.yml` metadata
  - `*.blockmap` files, except the macOS update `.zip.blockmap` removed after zip repack
- Production desktop builds omit web/server/desktop source maps by default to keep update payloads small. Set `SYNARA_WEB_SOURCEMAP=1`, `SYNARA_SERVER_SOURCEMAP=1`, or `SYNARA_DESKTOP_SOURCEMAP=1` only for a diagnostic release that needs them.
- macOS metadata note:
  - `electron-updater` reads `latest-mac.yml` for both Intel and Apple Silicon.
  - The workflow merges the per-arch mac manifests into one `latest-mac.yml` before publishing the GitHub Release.
  - The desktop build script repacks the macOS update `.zip` with `ditto`, verifies Electron framework symlinks, extracts the zip, validates the extracted app signature when signing is enabled, patches the matching `latest-mac*.yml` hash/size, and removes the stale `.zip.blockmap`.
  - macOS updater downloads intentionally use the full zip payload so Squirrel.Mac installs the exact archive validated by release build.
- Local smoke test:
  - Run `bun run release:smoke:mac-update -- --skip-build --build-version 0.1.5` on macOS after local desktop/server/web dist files exist.
  - The smoke builds a mock update artifact, validates manifest hash/size, serves a HEAD-only local endpoint, confirms the manifest and zip are addressable without downloading the zip body, then cleans up its temp output.
  - Boolean env flags for release scripts accept `true/false`, `1/0`, `yes/no`, and `on/off`; CLI flags are still preferred for repeatable local commands.

## 0) npm OIDC trusted publishing setup (CLI)

The workflow publishes the CLI with `bun publish` from `apps/server` after bumping
the package version to the release tag version.

Checklist:

1. Confirm npm org/user owns package `t3` (or rename package first if needed).
2. In npm package settings, configure Trusted Publisher:
   - Provider: GitHub Actions
   - Repository: this repo
   - Workflow file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Environment (if used): match your npm trusted publishing config
3. Ensure npm account and org policies allow trusted publishing for the package.
4. Create release tag `vX.Y.Z` and push; workflow will:
   - set `apps/server/package.json` version to `X.Y.Z`
   - build web + server
   - run `bun publish --access public`

## Synara notes

- `Synara` keeps the same release architecture as upstream `T3Code`, but publishes desktop artifacts under the Synara branding.
- The desktop updater expects the GitHub Release in this repository to include the generated updater metadata files, not just the installers.
- The published release title should read `Synara vX.Y.Z`.
- By default, the first-party desktop release path does not require CLI publish or post-release version-bump automation.
- Optional jobs stay disabled unless repository variables enable them:
  - `DPCODE_PUBLISH_CLI=1`
  - `DPCODE_FINALIZE_RELEASE=1`

## 1) Dry-run release without signing

Use this to validate the current unsigned macOS release pipeline.

1. Confirm no signing secrets are required for this test.
2. Create a test tag:
   - `git tag v0.0.0-test.1`
   - `git push origin v0.0.0-test.1`
3. Wait for `.github/workflows/release.yml` to finish.
4. Verify the GitHub Release contains all platform artifacts.
5. Download each artifact and sanity-check installation on each OS.

Unsigned macOS artifacts are blocked by Gatekeeper when downloaded through a browser. That is expected without Apple Developer ID signing/notarization. To run an unsigned build after dragging it to Applications:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Synara.app
open /Applications/Synara.app
```

## 2) Apple signing + notarization setup (macOS)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_API_KEY`
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Checklist:

1. Apple Developer account access:
   - Team has rights to create Developer ID certificates.
2. Create `Developer ID Application` certificate.
3. Export certificate + private key as `.p12` from Keychain.
4. Base64-encode the `.p12` and store as `CSC_LINK`.
5. Store the `.p12` export password as `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`.
6. In App Store Connect, create an API key (Team key).
7. Add API key values:
   - `APPLE_API_KEY`: contents of the downloaded `.p8`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: Key ID
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: Issuer ID
   - `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Team ID
8. Re-run a tag release and confirm macOS artifacts are signed/notarized.

Notes:

- `APPLE_API_KEY` is stored as raw key text in secrets.
- The workflow writes it to a temporary `AuthKey_<id>.p8` file at runtime.

## 3) Azure Trusted Signing setup (Windows)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`

Checklist:

1. Create Azure Trusted Signing account and certificate profile.
2. Record ATS values:
   - Endpoint
   - Account name
   - Certificate profile name
   - Publisher name
3. Create/choose an Entra app registration (service principal).
4. Grant service principal permissions required by Trusted Signing.
5. Create a client secret for the service principal.
6. Add Azure secrets listed above in GitHub Actions secrets.
7. Re-run a tag release and confirm Windows installer is signed.

## 4) Ongoing release checklist

1. Ensure `main` is green in CI.
2. Bump app version as needed.
3. Create release tag: `vX.Y.Z`.
4. Push tag.
5. Verify workflow steps: preflight passes, all matrix builds pass, signed macOS DMGs pass release signature verification when signing secrets are configured, and the release job uploads expected files.
6. Smoke test downloaded artifacts.

## 5) Troubleshooting

- macOS unsigned download shows "damaged" or cannot be opened:
  - This is Gatekeeper quarantine on an unsigned downloaded app. Remove quarantine locally with `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Synara.app`.
- macOS signing is skipped unexpectedly:
  - Check all Apple secrets are populated and non-empty.
  - Required secrets are `CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.
- macOS release signature verification fails:
  - Confirm electron-builder signed/notarized the app and DMG with the expected Developer ID certificate.
- Windows build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Azure ATS and auth secrets are populated and non-empty.
- Build fails with signing error:
  - Retry locally without signing to confirm packaging still works.
  - Re-check certificate/profile names and tenant/client credentials.

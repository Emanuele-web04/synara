// FILE: accountCredentialLock.test.ts
// Purpose: Coverage for the cross-process credential-file lock — stale
// threshold sizing (a slow legitimate holder must not be stolen from),
// owner-checked release (a holder that lost a stale takeover must not delete
// the new owner's lock), and stale takeover of a crashed process's lock.
// Layer: Server account tests

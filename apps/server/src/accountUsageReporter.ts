/**
 * accountUsageReporter - event-driven sync of per-minute usage buckets to the
 * account service (`POST /api/v1/usage`).
 *
 * The reporter never counts incrementally: every flush recomputes the buckets
 * for a recent window straight from the local projections and pushes ABSOLUTE
 * values, which the service upserts. Correctness therefore never depends on
 * exactly-once delivery — a retry, an overlap between two flushes, or the same
 * minute growing across pushes all land on the same rows.
 *
 * Fully inert when signed out, and silent best-effort when signed in: a failed
 * push records a backoff timestamp and waits for the next activity; it can
 * never break the server.
 *
 * Bucket derivation deliberately mirrors profileStats.ts (the canonical
 * sibling for token-delta and attribution SQL) and profileStatsArchive.ts,
 * adapted from local-day buckets to fixed UTC minutes.

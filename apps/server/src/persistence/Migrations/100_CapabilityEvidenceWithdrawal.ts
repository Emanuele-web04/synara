// FILE: 100_CapabilityEvidenceWithdrawal.ts
// Purpose: Adds a `withdrawn_at` column to the append-only capability
// observation store (KAR-530). Observations are never rewritten: when a live
// session withdraws a capability's evidence (unsafe outcome) the prior rows are
// *marked* withdrawn so policy derivation excludes them, but the raw history is
// preserved for audit. Purged rows (honeypot verdicts) are hard-deleted as
// before; this migration only adds the marker column.

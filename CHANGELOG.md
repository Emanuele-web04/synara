# Changelog

## 0.1.8 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Added an editor workspace view beside chat, including file browsing, workspace view state, syntax highlighting, file reference selection, code selection actions, and focused tests around editor metadata, workspace file-system APIs, workspace entries, chat references, and route state.
- Added native editor app discovery and icon caching, with authenticated editor icon routes, shared editor icon path constants, icon rendering in the web app, and broader launcher coverage for Ghostty, Terminal, JetBrains, Xcode, Zed, Cursor, VS Code, and platform-specific fallbacks.
- Added a unified provider skills catalog with provider-root awareness, shared skill ownership display, provider skill prompt injection, skills settings UI/model state, and coverage for Codex/Cursor/native-discovery fallbacks.
- Added provider status/auth refresh plumbing on focus and root orchestration events so Codex auth overlays and provider discovery state recover without stale UI.
- Added composer footer layout helpers, file reference parsing helpers, relative time utilities, syntax highlighting helpers, diff route search, and extra web tests for composer layout, file icons, provider updates, and root invalidation.

### Changed

- Refined the chat header, chat view, composer controls, model/trait/open-in pickers, inline chips, transcript selection actions, and code-selection flows so references and controls stay easier to scan during active work.
- Reworked the diff panel toolbar, file list, and patch viewport behavior to make large diffs easier to navigate from both repository and turn contexts.
- Reworked provider skill discovery so provider-native skill lists can merge with Synara's catalog and fall back cleanly when a provider cannot answer.
- Reconciled legacy migration trackers before running migrations and tightened older sidechat/pinned-thread migration paths.
- Updated desktop stage dependency overrides to keep `@pierre/diffs` pinned to `1.2.8`.
- Tightened terminal environment propagation, terminal manager behavior, workspace path containment, and provider command/runtime plumbing around recent server contracts.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale Codex auth overlay behavior so installed/authenticated Codex states refresh more reliably.
- Fixed skill settings provider display so only providers that actually own a skill are shown for shared skill entries.
- Fixed Ghostty/open-in behavior and native icon sizing so editor launchers open the intended project path and render consistently with other picker icons.
- Fixed file reference selection and mention/chip rendering edge cases across composer text, sent user bubbles, and markdown/code selection surfaces.
- Fixed migration startup edge cases for early installs that still had legacy tracker state.
- Fixed several provider discovery and skill catalog edge cases around missing native provider binaries, invalid provider responses, and provider-root normalization.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added Claude Fable 5 to the Claude and Cursor model surfaces, including the shared model contract, Cursor model variants, keybinding metadata, provider discovery invalidation, and focused model-picker coverage.
- Added Cursor ACP model discovery and refresh handling so Cursor-backed sessions can recover from stale, partial, or invalid model state more reliably.
- Added provider usage infrastructure for Codex, Claude, Cursor, and Gemini, including credential discovery, provider-specific parsers, shared display helpers, SQLite-backed snapshot caching, server RPC routes, and client snapshot normalization.
- Added provider usage UI in chat and settings: Environment panel usage rows, compact usage menu controls, progress tracks, line lists, limit rows, rate-limit opening helpers, and provider usage settings navigation.
- Added desktop backend Node option handling and tests, memory diagnostics, WebSocket stream backpressure guards, and provider runtime ingestion buffer coverage.
- Added centralized Windows desktop caption controls, top-bar gutter support, preload IPC wiring, and focused browser/unit coverage for sidebar, keybinding, composer, usage, and provider discovery paths.

### Changed

- Reworked the composer model/options picker flow so split pickers are used where they help, empty threads stay focused, and stacked composer panels share steadier sizing/content helpers.
- Refined Cursor provider integration around ACP capability checks, model support parsing, discovery refreshes, provider health, and adapter behavior.
- Unified provider usage display and pacing logic across server snapshots, shared helpers, React hooks, settings panels, and in-chat usage sections.
- Tightened Codex app-server recovery, backend memory limits, and streaming behavior so reconnects, partial streams, and live provider updates stay more predictable.
- Refined Windows desktop chrome to keep native-style controls in one fixed cluster and avoid custom titlebar paths outside Windows.
- Updated Linux download metadata to use the current `-x64` AppImage asset naming.

### Fixed

- Fixed plugin mention icons in sent user bubbles so selected plugin/file identity is preserved after sending.
- Fixed provider discovery invalidation so refreshed model lists can update the UI without stale model state lingering.
- Fixed usage parsing/display edge cases for provider-specific quota and pacing data.
- Fixed composer stacked panel sizing, queued/live-change header alignment, and trait-picker behavior around compact controls.
- Fixed sidebar/search palette state and route metadata edge cases covered by new tests.
- Fixed WebSocket backpressure and buffered provider-runtime ingestion cases that could otherwise leave live updates stale under load.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Added transcript text markers with orchestration events, projection persistence, migration `042_ProjectionThreadsMarkers`, shared marker validation, transcript selection actions, marker-aware scrolling, and an Environment panel marker section.
- Added website favicon support for markdown links, composer/user-bubble link chips, and bare-domain link parsing, backed by a server-side favicon cache and authenticated favicon image route.
- Added local server monitoring, project-run tracking, local-server Environment panel rows, sidebar/project-run controls, and WebSocket/RPC contracts for listing and stopping tracked dev servers.
- Added terminal/project visual identity helpers and project-run target/running helpers so local server and terminal surfaces can share clearer labels and icons.
- Added focused tests for marker round-trips, marker scrolling, local server monitoring, project run targets, terminal visual identity, favicon parsing/cache behavior, and link chip parsing.

### Changed

- Refined transcript rendering and timeline behavior so marker navigation, markdown highlights, collapsed work disclosures, and auto-scroll follow logic are less likely to fight each other.
- Unified link rendering across AI responses, composer chips, and sent user bubbles so site identity, favicon fallback, alignment, and medium-weight text stay consistent.
- Reworked local-server discovery around listener address-family metadata, project ownership matching, and tracked PTY/dev-server state.
- Refined recent view switching, browser panel identity, terminal chrome sizing, and local server display state around project-aware surfaces.
- Tightened orchestration projection and provider/runtime handling around markers, thread updates, local server state, and terminal/runtime cleanup.

### Fixed

- Fixed retired model picker keybindings so shortcuts keep working when hidden/retired model entries are present.
- Fixed collapsed work disclosures retriggering tail-scroll behavior after output had already settled.
- Fixed formatter drift in `apps/server/src/wsRpc.ts` and `apps/web/src/lib/serverReactQuery.ts`.
- Fixed the local-server test fixture to include the required listener address `family` field.
- Fixed bare domains such as `linear.app/...` being ignored by composer/user-bubble link chip parsing while full `https://...` links worked.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check` initially failed on `apps/server/src/wsRpc.ts` and `apps/web/src/lib/serverReactQuery.ts`; both files were formatted and the rerun passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 145 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` initially failed in `apps/server/src/devServerManager.test.ts` because a `ServerLocalServerProcess` fixture lacked `family`; after the fixture fix, `bun run typecheck` passed.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed.
- `bun run build` passed.
- `bun run test` failed in `packages/effect-acp/src/client.test.ts` on `replays buffered notifications to handlers registered after they arrive` with a 5000ms timeout; Turbo canceled the server test package afterward with code 130.
- `bun run test src/client.test.ts -t "replays buffered notifications to handlers registered after they arrive"` from `packages/effect-acp` passed (1 test passed, 4 skipped).
- `bun run --cwd apps/server test -- --reporter verbose --maxWorkers=1` passed (112 files passed, 1 skipped; 1108 tests passed, 6 skipped).

## 0.1.5 - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added macOS update artifact smoke tooling, zip finalization helpers, and boolean environment parsing tests for the desktop release path.
- Added focused diff panel components for the toolbar, file jump menu, file list, patch viewport, and selector helpers.
- Added browser/unit coverage for queued turn auto-dispatch, plan-mode queued chat turns, composer stacked panel framing, diff view-source logic, provider discovery, markdown rendering, and mention/file icon behavior.

### Changed

- Refreshed README/release messaging and Synara desktop update flow documentation around the current app positioning.
- Reworked the diff panel around explicit repo-vs-turn state, searchable file filtering, and smaller view components.
- Unified composer stacked panels above the input so plan activity, queued follow-ups, and live file-change rows share width, border, radius, and dark-mode opacity.
- Refined chat markdown spacing, composer command menu selection, provider/plugin discovery normalization, and file/plugin icon rendering in sent messages.

### Fixed

- Fixed queued chat dispatch so queued turns preserve their own interaction mode, attachments, and prompt while a plan follow-up is pending.
- Fixed live file-change composer chrome so it appears only for active turns with actual provider file edits.
- Fixed draft/reference handling so selected plugin and file mentions keep their structured references and icons after navigation or reload.
- Removed the older update-feed cache path in favor of the newer resumable update download coverage.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Added project, thread, and message pinning across the orchestration projection, persistence layer, shared pin helpers, sidebar state, environment panel, and focused web stores.
- Added environment-panel pinned-message management and autosaved thread notes so durable context can live beside the transcript without being mixed into the chat stream.
- Added a recent-view switcher with keyboard navigation, keycap hints, route activation logic, persistent recent-view tracking, and browser/unit coverage.
- Added resumable desktop update download infrastructure with dedicated tests for partial files, persisted metadata, retry behavior, and interrupted download recovery.
- Added pull-availability data to the Git contract/server/web path so Git action controls can reflect whether pull is actually safe and useful for the current branch.
- Added broader tests for keybindings, composer mentions, composer drafts, pinned projects/threads/messages, thread detail prewarming, recent views, migrations, and release browser flows.

### Changed

- Reworked the sidebar/project/thread pinning model around shared logic so pinned state is projected consistently after reloads, legacy migration reconciliation, and snapshot refreshes.
- Expanded the chat environment surface with dedicated pinned and notes sections, tighter environment row styling, and shared action hooks for pin/unpin flows.
- Tightened composer behavior around mention icons, draft references, queued headers, picker styling, compact controls, and empty-chat controls.
- Improved runtime resilience around external Claude shutdowns, terminal manager cleanup, websocket RPC error flow, and provider session recovery.
- Refined projection snapshot queries and pipeline behavior so pinned messages, notes, and project pins are present in thread detail and orchestration snapshots.
- Updated release/browser tests and mocks around the recent switcher, keybindings, and app release surfaces.

### Fixed

- Fixed pinned-state migrations and legacy reconciliation so older projected thread data can upgrade cleanly.
- Fixed composer mention icon rendering and draft reference handling.
- Fixed release browser tests by adding switcher keycap coverage and the needed test mock.
- Fixed Git action availability checks that previously had to infer pull state too late in the UI.
- Fixed external Claude SIGTERM handling so an outside shutdown is treated as a benign suspended session instead of a failed turn.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check`
- `bun run lint` (passes with 138 warnings, 0 errors)
- `bun run typecheck` (passes with TS44 informational messages about JSON usage in tests/protocol files)

- Added richer agent activity detail surfaces so subagent/task rows can be opened and inspected from the transcript flow.
- Added release notes for `0.1.3` to the built-in What's New / Release History data.

### Changed

- Reworked transcript, chat header, environment panel, Git action, branch toolbar, and queued composer rendering so busy sessions remain easier to scan.
- Computed repo diff totals once in `ChatView` and reused them across the header and environment panel, avoiding duplicate large-patch parsing during live updates.
- Streamlined archived-thread deletion through shared client helpers, including optimistic local removal, batched worktree-linked cleanup, and a single shell snapshot reconciliation.
- Made desktop update UI quieter during background polling and kept production web/server/desktop sourcemaps disabled by default unless explicitly enabled for diagnostics.
- Tightened terminal runtime cleanup, shell summary handling, provider activity ingestion, and session handoff safeguards.
- Refined composer attachment, reference chip, queued row, and compact control spacing for a cleaner release build.

### Fixed

- Fixed TypeScript exact-optional-property failures in optional callback pass-throughs.
- Fixed recap generation test doubles to use the shared `ThreadRecapGenerationInput` contract.
- Updated image attachment chip tests to match the current compact thumbnail UI.

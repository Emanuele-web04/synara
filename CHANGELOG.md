# Changelog

## 0.3.1 - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Added transcript tool-call detail dialogs and formatting helpers for command output, patches, file changes, and tool output so command-heavy turns are easier to inspect.
- Added regression coverage for tool-call labels, tool-call detail formatting, message timeline grouping, sidebar hover-card anchoring, keybindings, Gemini ACP probing, provider runtime ingestion, ProviderService behavior, electron-updater security, and Windows process handling.
- Added a curated central icon asset set and provider/UI icon plumbing used by newer picker, header, sidebar, and preview surfaces.
- Added more explicit project and thread hover-card content, thread pin toggle behavior, recent view switching, and project shortcut targeting.

### Changed

- Bumped Synara release package versions to `0.3.1` across the server, desktop, web, and contracts packages.
- Refined session orchestration and transcript handling so assistant messages, tool/work rows, collapsed turns, runtime activity, and sidechat state stay separated more predictably.
- Improved chat header, recent-view, sidebar, split-chat, and hover-card navigation for multi-pane workflows.
- Tightened keyboard shortcut defaults and persisted keybinding migrations for chat creation, terminal creation, navigation, and duplicate/stale binding rows.
- Expanded provider runtime ingestion for canonical Codex event shapes, generated-image markdown, MCP tool progress, reasoning deltas, proposed-plan events, and synthetic placeholder thread ids.
- Hardened provider management around idle runtime retention, provider health refresh, process cleanup, Cursor/Gemini/Grok adapter paths, OpenCode runtime handling, and Gemini ACP probe parsing.
- Made automation setup/update flows stricter by separating conversational setup prompts, update-only approval paths, approval fallback behavior, prompt filler removal, and risk acknowledgement gating.
- Improved desktop startup/update handling by reducing noisy Node deprecation warnings and tightening electron-updater Windows command construction.
- Refined composer, automation banners, provider/model pickers, Kanban cards, preview cards, tooltip primitives, and project/sidebar icons with smaller consistency fixes.
- Welcomed focused external contributions in the project docs and README while keeping the early-WIP guidance explicit.

### Fixed

- Fixed transcript tool-call inspection gaps where shell command output, patch details, and normalized tool output were hard to review from the UI.
- Fixed session orchestration edge cases around review interrupt retry, compaction progress, runtime event replay, generated image completion replay, and provider-thread placeholder matching.
- Fixed provider runtime warning and ingestion paths that could mishandle missing usage details, auxiliary turn completions, or non-active turn completions in synthetic/runtime tests.
- Fixed automation approval regressions around update-only flows, fallback prompts, conversational setup follow-up text, and dispatch-time risk acknowledgement.
- Fixed desktop updater command-hardening coverage and reduced startup warning noise from desktop Node behavior.
- Fixed formatting drift caught by the release gate in `apps/server/src/keybindings.test.ts` and `apps/web/src/components/chat/ToolCallDetailsDialog.tsx`.

### Verification

- Initial `bun run fmt:check` failed on `apps/server/src/keybindings.test.ts` and `apps/web/src/components/chat/ToolCallDetailsDialog.tsx`; after targeted `bunx oxfmt` on those two files, `bun run fmt:check` passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 156 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` passed across all 8 packages with the existing TS44 informational JSON messages.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed and left `bun.lock` unchanged.
- `bun run build` passed. The build still reports existing Astro `transformWithEsbuild`, tsdown/plugin timing, desktop typeless-module, and large Vite chunk warnings.
- `bun run test` passed: 10 tasks successful in 5m6s. `@t3tools/web` passed 182 files / 2164 tests. `t3` passed 135 files with 1 skipped file, 1456 passed tests, and 6 skipped tests.
- Website changelog mirror checks passed in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website`: `npm run build` prerendered `/changelog/v0.3.1`, and `npm run lint` passed.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Added first-class Automations as a real Synara workspace surface, including contracts, persistence, scheduler leases, run tracking, RPC methods, sidebar navigation, list/detail routes, Current/Paused views, inline detail editing, previous-run history, and triage actions.
- Added automation scheduler and composer flows so saved prompts can run manually, once, on intervals, daily, on weekdays, weekly, or from cron-like schedules.
- Added heartbeat automations that continue an existing target thread on each scheduled wake while preserving the normal provider/session/approval/worktree pipeline.
- Added AI-evaluated heartbeat stop clauses through completion policies, natural-language stop conditions, completion-evaluation results, and visible stop reasons in run history.
- Added a dedicated background queue for AI stop checks so slow or stuck completion evaluation does not block automation reconciliation.
- Added timeout handling for stop evaluation, recording a visible warning result and keeping the heartbeat alive when the evaluator stalls.
- Added automation recovery and scheduler observability for swallowed recovery failures and scheduler lease contention.
- Added DST and long-downtime scheduler coverage for spring-forward gaps, fall-back duplicate hours, and coalesced missed interval runs.
- Added generic chat file attachments alongside image attachments, with shared contracts, upload storage, composer paste/drop support, provider prompt projection, optimistic timeline rendering, Kanban dispatch, recap/bootstrap support, and reusable file attachment cards/chips.
- Added automation cards in the chat transcript after automation creation, and added thread automation summaries in the Environment panel.
- Added blob-based browser download handling for local image/generated markdown image downloads so failed local-image responses stay inside Synara instead of navigating the app window to an API error page.
- Added OpenCode CLI-only model discovery fallback so the model picker can still discover available models when the managed server or inventory path fails.
- Added profile skill usage counting coverage for retention-hidden threads and repeated slash/dollar skill invocations.

### Changed

- Bumped Synara release package versions to `0.3.0` across the server, desktop, web, and contracts packages.
- Reworked automation UI toward a Codex-style surface, including the sidebar badge, Current/Paused list, centered detail layout, inline rail editing, schedule editing, target-thread display, max-iteration controls, stop-on-error handling, and previous-run actions.
- Expanded automation composer parsing and review so explicit/generated prompts, schedule phrases, stop clauses, bounded fast loops, restored plan source metadata, queued plan follow-ups, and inline composer editing are handled consistently.
- Made generated automation intents require confirmation before creation, while preserving deterministic local auto-submit behavior for explicitly parsed bounded fast loops.
- Tightened automation cache updates by guarding live definition/run upserts with `updatedAt` and handling equal timestamps without letting stale events roll back newer cache rows.
- Consolidated scheduler-critical SQL around pending completion evaluation and run listing, including a shared view and a bounded evaluation backlog.
- Scoped OpenCode/Kilo server startup and CLI discovery to the request/session cwd, avoided cross-cwd warm server reuse, preserved OpenCode resume cwd, and stopped replacing file config with synthetic empty config content.
- Treated omitted Claude interaction mode as the default/base permission so fresh threads do not inherit sticky plan mode from the previously active thread.
- Preserved attachment-bearing plan follow-ups by routing them through the normal send path while keeping source plan metadata, including queued sends.
- Made composer image blob URL ownership clearer by revoking on normal clears while preserving ownership for optimistic handoff.
- Made composer dropzone generic-file support explicit and visibly rejected unsupported Kanban task files.
- Kept Environment panel open/close preference stable across chat switches while defaulting constrained/floating chat layouts to a calmer closed panel.
- Avoided full thread subscription for file previews and reused thread runtime workspace resolution so worktree-backed chat file/PDF links open in the correct right-dock preview root.
- Included retention-hidden threads in profile stats while still excluding manually deleted threads and deleted projects.

### Fixed

- Fixed automation lifecycle bugs around crash replay, failed-run rollback, duplicate scheduled occurrences, in-flight guards, terminal run transitions, cancellation behavior, and failed update rollback.
- Fixed automation worktree cleanup when standalone thread creation fails or cancellation wins before durable thread ownership exists.
- Fixed automation approval-wait reconciliation so a heartbeat run re-checks turn ownership before leaving `waiting-for-approval`, avoiding resurrection after a different turn takes over the target thread.
- Fixed a completion-evaluation race where a background stop check could clobber a user's archived/read state on the same automation run.
- Fixed stale completion-evaluation results being accepted after an automation changed before evaluation finished.
- Fixed automation review regressions around draft-thread promotion, restored source-thread metadata, source plan persistence, reruns, triage/detail actions, and provider start options.
- Fixed local image downloads so failed `/api/local-image` responses cannot replace the desktop renderer with a plain `Not Found` page.
- Fixed deleted chats staying visible by removing successful deletes from client projections immediately, adding client tombstones, and keeping archived bulk deletes responsive.
- Fixed worktree-backed file/PDF previews from chat links so absolute paths under a materialized worktree do not fall back to the default editor/main surface.
- Fixed OpenCode model discovery fallback so a failed server/inventory path no longer leaves the UI looking like only static GPT-5 is available.
- Fixed OpenCode provider config and sticky plan-mode behavior around cwd-scoped discovery, resume cwd, and fresh-thread bootstrap.
- Fixed attachment handling issues around attachment caps, server normalization rollback, unsupported files, plan follow-ups, image URL cleanup, and attachment drag/drop audit findings.
- Fixed profile skill counts so repeated `/skill` or `$skill` tokens in one prompt count correctly without double-counting structured skill references.
- Fixed release-blocking typecheck drift in automation worktree cleanup tests by asserting the created worktree branch before using it.
- Fixed formatting drift in the automation service test and local image preview download error description.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check` passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 151 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` passed across all 8 packages with the existing TS44 informational JSON messages.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed and refreshed install/lockfile state.
- `bun run build` passed. The build still reports existing large web chunk/plugin timing warnings, the Astro `transformWithEsbuild` deprecation warning, and the desktop `tsdown.config.ts` typeless-module warning.
- `bun run test` passed: 10 tasks successful in 8m53s. `@t3tools/web` passed 180 files / 2102 tests. `t3` passed 135 files with 1 skipped file, 1418 passed tests, and 6 skipped tests. The server suite was long-running but completed cleanly without a teardown stall.
- Website changelog mirror checks passed in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website`: `npm run build` prerendered `/changelog/v0.3.0`, and `npm run lint` passed.

## 0.2.41 - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Added a compact chat-header handoff menu so handoff threads can be created directly from the active chat header again.
- Added provider-target filtering for the handoff menu so only currently usable handoff destinations are offered.

### Changed

- Bumped Synara release package versions to `0.2.41` across the server, desktop, web, and contracts packages.
- Kept the shared project-action dialog path mounted while hiding the visible inline project script runner from the chat header.
- Improved header handoff failure handling by checking provider send availability before creating a handoff and showing a toast when the target is unavailable.

### Fixed

- Fixed the missing header handoff action after the previous chat-header cleanup.
- Fixed chat-header crowding from the project script runner while preserving the project action dialog plumbing used by other header actions.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check` passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 148 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` passed with the existing TS44 informational JSON messages.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed and left the worktree unchanged.
- `bun run build` passed. Vite still warns about large web chunks and plugin timings; desktop build still reports the existing typeless `tsdown.config.ts` module warning.
- Root `bun run test` did not complete cleanly in two attempts: both runs reached a green `@t3tools/web` suite (169 files / 1954 tests), then stalled in the `apps/server` Vitest tail. The stale duplicate root/Vitest processes were stopped before continuing verification.
- Direct `bun run test` from `apps/server` also stalled before reporting test-file progress, only printing Node SQLite experimental warnings, so it is not counted as passed.
- Direct package tests passed for the release-relevant and non-server packages: `apps/web` 169 files / 1954 tests, `packages/contracts` 9 files / 90 tests, `packages/shared` 24 files / 228 tests, `packages/effect-acp` 3 files / 24 tests, `apps/desktop` 19 files / 149 tests, and `scripts` 5 files / 36 tests.
- `apps/marketing` has no `test` script.
- `npm run build` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed and generated `/changelog/v0.2.41`.
- `npm run lint` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Added focused route-restore recovery coverage so remembered chat routes wait for a fresh snapshot before falling back after restart.
- Added disabled-provider re-enable regression coverage for provider health refreshes.

### Changed

- Bumped Synara release package versions to `0.2.4` across the server, desktop, web, and contracts packages.
- Improved remembered chat route restore so stale empty startup snapshots do not immediately send users to the empty chat route.
- Removed the old handoff shortcut from the chat header to keep primary conversation controls quieter.

### Fixed

- Fixed app restart/chat restore behavior where a valid remembered thread could briefly appear missing while orchestration state was still loading.
- Fixed provider health refresh behavior around re-enabling disabled providers so availability state is less likely to remain stale.
- Fixed formatting drift in `apps/web/src/chatRouteRestore.ts` caught by `bun run fmt:check`.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check` initially failed on `apps/web/src/chatRouteRestore.ts`; after formatting that file, `bun run fmt:check` passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 149 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` passed with the existing TS44 informational JSON messages.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed and refreshed release install/lockfile state.
- `bun run build` passed. Vite still warns about large web chunks and plugin timings; desktop build still reports the existing typeless `tsdown.config.ts` module warning.
- `bun run test` passed: 10 tasks successful, including `@t3tools/web` 169 files / 1954 tests and `t3` 129 files passed / 1 skipped with 1255 passed / 6 skipped.
- `npm run build` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed and generated `/changelog/v0.2.4`.
- `npm run lint` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added richer local profile statistics, including most-worked project, skill/agent usage, active hours, provider/model mix, reasoning usage, and token/activity heatmap data.
- Added compact pasted-text cards for large composer pastes, with line/character metadata, remove controls, restore-to-editor behavior, and expandable sent-message echoes.
- Added shared pasted-text parsing/serialization helpers and focused coverage for composer drafts, pasted text, assistant selections, terminal context, and transcript height handling.

### Changed

- Bumped Synara release package versions to `0.2.3` across the server, desktop, web, and contracts packages.
- Improved profile skill usage counting by combining structured skill references, mentions, agent references, and legacy text-token backfill while filtering obvious non-skill slash/dollar tokens.
- Kept large pasted prompt content out of the visible composer body by storing it as structured prompt context, making long prompts easier to scan and refine.

### Fixed

- Fixed message editing so pasted text blocks remain intact when a user edits a previous message.
- Fixed draft/edit preservation for structured prompt context so pasted text, terminal context, and assistant selections are less likely to be dropped or flattened across composer lifecycle changes.
- Fixed profile stats so prompt-block markup like pasted text, file comments, terminal context, and assistant selections does not pollute skill counting.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check` passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 148 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` passed with the existing TS44 informational JSON messages.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed and refreshed release install/lockfile state.
- `bun run build` passed. Vite still warns about large web chunks and plugin timings; desktop build still reports the existing typeless `tsdown.config.ts` module warning.
- `bun run test` passed: 10 tasks successful, including `@t3tools/web` 168 files / 1949 tests and `t3` 129 files passed / 1 skipped with 1246 passed / 6 skipped.
- `npm run build` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed and generated `/changelog/v0.2.3`.
- `npm run lint` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Added richer profile and personalization surfaces, including profile stats, activity heatmap polish, profile editing updates, and settings panel refinements.
- Added soft-delete thread retention coverage so deleted thread data has clearer cleanup behavior during early WIP usage.
- Added release-test stability safeguards for child-process ACP fixtures and the server Vitest runner.

### Changed

- Improved live composer edit visibility so per-turn composer changes stay attached to the active turn lifecycle.
- Refined curated app/profile UI details across the settings, profile dialog, activity heatmap, and chat route.
- Changed the server test script to run Vitest files serially, avoiding Turbo teardown stalls caused by lingering server Vitest workers after otherwise-passing test runs.

### Fixed

- Fixed flaky `effect-acp` child-process fixture tests by giving slow process-backed assertions an explicit timeout.
- Fixed full root `bun run test` release validation getting stuck after green server test output by making the server package test runner deterministic under Turbo.
- Fixed formatting drift in the profile, retention, and chat-route files that had reached `main`.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check` initially failed on `apps/server/src/threadRetention.test.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/profile/ActivityHeatmap.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/profile/EditProfileDialog.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/settings/ProfileSettingsPanel.tsx`, and `apps/web/src/routes/_chat.tsx`; after formatting those files, `bun run fmt:check` passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 148 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` passed with the existing TS44 informational JSON messages.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed and refreshed release install/lockfile state.
- `bun run build` passed. Vite still warns about large web chunks and plugin timings; desktop build still reports the existing typeless `tsdown.config.ts` module warning.
- Initial full `bun run test` failed in `packages/effect-acp` on 5000ms child-process fixture timeouts, then repeated with timeouts in `packages/effect-acp/src/client.test.ts` and `packages/effect-acp/src/protocol.test.ts`. Targeted reruns passed after adding explicit fixture timeouts.
- A subsequent root `bun run test` reached green server test output but did not return because the server Vitest process kept worker forks alive during Turbo teardown. Direct server testing showed the suite exits cleanly with `--maxWorkers=1 --no-file-parallelism`, so the server test script was updated accordingly.
- Final `bun run test` passed: 10 tasks successful, including `@t3tools/web` 167 files / 1935 tests, `effect-acp` 3 files / 24 tests, and `t3` 129 files passed / 1 skipped with 1241 passed / 6 skipped.
- `npm run build` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed and generated `/changelog/v0.2.2`.
- `npm run lint` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Added inline file comments from composer and preview surfaces, including line comment boxes, comment summary chips, draft persistence, reference attachment support, chat timeline rendering, and file-comment parsing helpers.
- Added startup turn reconciliation for provider restarts so Synara can recover unfinished turns from persisted runtime state instead of leaving stale active work behind.
- Added an ACP idle watchdog used by ACP-backed providers so quiet turns can complete or fail more predictably when runtime events stop flowing.
- Added partial workspace reference lookup helpers and tests so shortened file references can resolve to the intended workspace entry.

### Changed

- Scoped live changed-file activity to the active turn by carrying active turn identity through provider runtime ingestion, Codex/Claude adapter events, checkpoint handling, chat selectors, and composer live-change headers.
- Improved workspace file opening from chat and preview references so missing prefixes or partial paths are handled through shared workspace file-system logic.
- Refined provider restart recovery across Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, runtime ingestion, command cleanup, and shared thread summaries so session state is less likely to drift after reconnects.
- Extended comment and reference handling through kanban dispatch, terminal context, composer attachments, editor workspace, dock preview, and compact composer controls.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale live changed-files panels that could show file edits from a previous or inactive turn.
- Fixed partial file references failing to open when assistant output did not include the full workspace-relative path.
- Fixed restart and idle-watchdog paths that could leave turns hanging after provider interruption, reconnect, or quiet ACP runtime behavior.
- Fixed composer/file-preview context loss when attaching line comments to a prompt or preserving them across draft updates.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check` passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 146 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` passed with the existing TS44 informational JSON messages.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed and refreshed release install/lockfile state.
- `bun run build` passed. Vite still warns about large web chunks and plugin timings; marketing still reports the `transformWithEsbuild` deprecation warning; desktop build still reports the existing typeless `tsdown.config.ts` module warning.
- First full `bun run test` before release-note edits did not complete cleanly: visible server integration and checkpoint suites passed, including `integration/orchestrationEngine.integration.test.ts` and `src/orchestration/Layers/CheckpointReactor.test.ts`, but the root Turbo/Vitest run stopped producing output during teardown with two server Vitest worker forks still alive. The stale `bun`/`turbo`/Vitest process group was interrupted, so this run is not counted as a full pass.
- Final `bun run test` from `apps/web` passed: 165 files passed, 1909 tests passed.
- Final `bun run test` from `packages/effect-acp` passed: 3 files passed, 24 tests passed.
- Final direct server rerun `bun run test -- --maxWorkers=1` from `apps/server` passed: 128 files passed, 1 skipped; 1238 tests passed, 6 skipped.
- `npm run build` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed and generated `/changelog/v0.2.1`.
- `npm run lint` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added a secure in-app PDF previewer backed by pdf.js, including page rendering, toolbar controls, zoom helpers, page navigation state, container sizing, document loading, page render cancellation, and PDF link normalization.
- Added `PdfFilePreview`, `WorkspaceFilePreview`, and a shared preview header so the right dock and editor workspace can render source files, images, markdown, and PDFs through one consistent preview path.
- Added authenticated local preview route coverage for image/PDF files, including workspace and scratch-workspace allowlists for generated local artifacts.
- Added Pi plugin/ACP startup prompt handling, model discovery support, cwd/session routing, provider service safeguards, and a mock ACP agent for focused provider tests.
- Added Cmd+L composer focus support across keybinding metadata, server/web keybinding definitions, shortcut-sheet data, and tests.
- Added markdown task-list parsing/rendering so checklist-style assistant output displays as task lists instead of plain bracket text.
- Added workspace file opener helpers, local preview URL helpers, file reference context-menu helpers, PDF zoom/link/navigation tests, chat view selector coverage, session logic tests, and extra right-dock runtime activation coverage.

### Changed

- Reworked file preview ownership by moving large preview behavior out of `EditorWorkspaceView` and into reusable preview components shared with the dock pane.
- Replaced the older nested changed-files tree/turn-diff-tree path with a flatter changed-files UI and simpler file-list behavior.
- Optimized chat startup and timeline derivation by tightening chat view selectors, route state handling, timeline ordering, collapsed settled-turn behavior, and timeline height calculations.
- Refined right-dock pane metadata and activation so file preview, PDF preview, and dock pane lifecycle state stay more predictable across chat/editor surfaces.
- Improved composer/user-input polish around inline mention chips, composer banners, pending user input panels, provider model picker state, and shortcut labels.
- Refined local preview file handling by renaming the shared helper from local image-only logic to broader local preview-file logic.
- Updated open-in target launcher prop naming and editor launcher hooks to match the newer workspace/dock preview surfaces.

### Fixed

- Fixed unsafe PDF preview behavior by sanitizing annotation links, rejecting unsafe URL schemes, resetting navigation when a new document loads, and avoiding stale page proxies after switching PDFs.
- Fixed local preview exposure risks by tightening preview response CORS/auth behavior and ensuring local file access stays scoped to allowed workspace/scratch paths.
- Fixed scratch workspace path generation so thread-derived scratch folders cannot smuggle path separators or traversal segments.
- Fixed Pi plugin UI routing, startup prompt delivery, model discovery for extensions, and cwd handling for provider-backed sessions.
- Fixed Cursor message id handling and stale changed-files presentation cases.
- Fixed duplicate plan mode icons, stale plan sidebar state, and noisy inline project actions in the chat header.
- Fixed settled-turn collapse fallback and timeline tail behavior when visible turn ids are empty or transcript rows update during long-running work.
- Fixed local image/PDF preview cleanup cases so loaded PDF documents and text layers are destroyed or cancelled when switching files, pages, or zoom levels.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check` passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 144 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` passed with the existing TS44 informational JSON messages.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed and refreshed release install/lockfile state.
- `bun run build` passed. Vite still warns about large web chunks and plugin timings; marketing still reports the `transformWithEsbuild` deprecation warning; desktop build still reports the existing typeless `tsdown.config.ts` module warning.
- First full `bun run test` before release-note edits did not pass: `apps/server/integration/orchestrationEngine.integration.test.ts` failed `runs a single turn end-to-end and persists checkpoint state in sqlite + git`, and `apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/CheckpointReactor.test.ts` failed `captures pre-turn baseline on turn.started and post-turn checkpoint on turn.completed`. The run then hung during teardown and was stopped after identifying and killing the stale `bun`/`turbo`/Vitest worker processes.
- Targeted rerun `bun run test src/orchestration/Layers/CheckpointReactor.test.ts -t "captures pre-turn baseline on turn.started and post-turn checkpoint on turn.completed"` from `apps/server` passed: 1 test passed, 15 skipped.
- Targeted rerun `bun run test integration/orchestrationEngine.integration.test.ts -t "runs a single turn end-to-end and persists checkpoint state in sqlite + git"` from `apps/server` could not reproduce the live integration test because the file uses `it.live`; the standard targeted Vitest command skipped all 12 tests.
- Final full `bun run test` after version and release-note edits did not pass: `packages/effect-acp/src/client.test.ts` timed out in `returns formatted invalid params when a typed extension request payload is wrong`, and `packages/effect-acp/src/protocol.test.ts` timed out in `does not emit a second process-exit error after a decode failure`. Turbo reported 7 successful tasks, canceled `t3:test` and `@t3tools/web:test` with code 130, and exited with `effect-acp#test` failed.
- Targeted rerun `bun run test src/client.test.ts -t "returns formatted invalid params when a typed extension request payload is wrong"` from `packages/effect-acp` passed: 1 test passed, 4 skipped.
- Targeted rerun `bun run test src/protocol.test.ts -t "does not emit a second process-exit error after a decode failure"` from `packages/effect-acp` passed: 1 test passed, 16 skipped.
- Full `packages/effect-acp` rerun passed: 3 files passed, 24 tests passed.
- Full `apps/web` rerun passed: 164 files passed, 1894 tests passed.

- `npm run build` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed and generated `/changelog/v0.2.0`.
- `npm run lint` in `/Users/emanueledipietro/Developer/dpcode-website` passed.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added Codex-style chat workspace folder creation and associated workspace/worktree metadata so generated chat files are easier to isolate per conversation.
- Added settings sidebar search deep links and related project/settings navigation polish.
- Added a World Cup soccer ball physics playground as a self-contained interactive visual surface.
- Added file-only workspace search refinements and stronger provider probe handling around Gemini-backed paths.

### Changed

- Reworked transcript turn collapse and live-tail behavior so collapsed work rows, latest-turn fallback, and active transcript scrolling stay calmer during long or partially visible turns.
- Improved browser session handling and copy-link flow behavior for in-app browsing and chat reference movement.
- Refined UI density controls, sidebar spacing, composer spacing, and settings page opening performance.
- Replaced bespoke editor project menu behavior with the shared `ProjectMenuPicker` path.
- Split kanban composer menu discovery from editor logic so each surface owns less unrelated state.
- Shared local image preview state and error-card handling across chat and editor views.

### Fixed

- Fixed server typecheck and formatting drift that reached `main` after the soccer playground merge.
- Fixed transcript turn collapse and tail jitter cases where visible turn ids could be empty while a latest turn still had active work.
- Fixed browser/copy-link edge cases that could leave stale browser session state or awkward link movement.
- Fixed editor mode production feedback and local image preview duplication between chat and editor surfaces.
- Fixed settings page re-render churn caused by streaming ticks while opening settings.

### Verification

- `bun run fmt:check` passed.
- `bun run lint` passed with 143 warnings, 0 errors.
- `bun run typecheck` passed with the existing TS44 informational JSON messages.
- `bun run release:smoke` passed.
- `bun run build` passed. Vite still warns about large web chunks and plugin timings; desktop build still reports the existing typeless `tsdown.config.ts` module warning.
- First `bun run test` attempt visibly completed the long web/server/integration suites without an assertion failure, then hung during final server Vitest teardown with two workers still alive; it was interrupted and is not counted as a full pass.
- Final full `bun run test` after release-note and version edits failed in `packages/effect-acp/src/client.test.ts` on two 5000ms timeouts: `returns formatted invalid params when a typed extension request payload is wrong` and `replays buffered notifications to handlers registered after they arrive`. Turbo canceled `t3:test` with code 130 after the `effect-acp` failure, so the full run is not counted as passed.
- Targeted rerun `bun run test src/client.test.ts -t "returns formatted invalid params when a typed extension request payload is wrong|replays buffered notifications to handlers registered after they arrive"` from `packages/effect-acp` passed: 2 tests passed, 3 skipped.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Added an editor workspace view beside chat, including file browsing, workspace view state, syntax highlighting, file reference selection, code selection actions, and focused tests around editor metadata, workspace file-system APIs, workspace entries, chat references, and route state.
- Added native editor app discovery and icon caching, with authenticated editor icon routes, shared editor icon path constants, icon rendering in the web app, and broader launcher coverage for Ghostty, Terminal, JetBrains, Xcode, Zed, Cursor, VS Code, and platform-specific fallbacks.
- Added a unified provider skills catalog with provider-root awareness, shared skill ownership display, provider skill prompt injection, skills settings UI/model state, and coverage for Codex/Cursor/native-discovery fallbacks.
- Added provider status/auth refresh plumbing on focus and root orchestration events so Codex auth overlays and provider discovery state recover without stale UI.
- Added composer footer layout helpers, file reference parsing helpers, relative time utilities, syntax highlighting helpers, diff route search, and extra web tests for composer layout, file icons, provider updates, and root invalidation.

### Changed

- Refined the chat header, chat view, composer controls, model/trait/open-in pickers, inline chips, transcript selection actions, and code-selection flows so references and controls stay easier to scan during active work.
- Reworked the diff panel toolbar, file list, and patch viewport behavior to make large diffs easier to navigate from both repository and turn contexts.
- Reworked provider skill discovery so provider-native skill lists can merge with Synara's catalog and fall back cleanly when a provider cannot answer.
- Reconciled legacy migration trackers before running migrations and tightened older sidechat/pinned-thread migration paths.
- Updated desktop stage dependency overrides to keep `@pierre/diffs` pinned to `1.2.8`.
- Tightened terminal environment propagation, terminal manager behavior, workspace path containment, and provider command/runtime plumbing around recent server contracts.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale Codex auth overlay behavior so installed/authenticated Codex states refresh more reliably.
- Fixed skill settings provider display so only providers that actually own a skill are shown for shared skill entries.
- Fixed Ghostty/open-in behavior and native icon sizing so editor launchers open the intended project path and render consistently with other picker icons.
- Fixed file reference selection and mention/chip rendering edge cases across composer text, sent user bubbles, and markdown/code selection surfaces.
- Fixed migration startup edge cases for early installs that still had legacy tracker state.
- Fixed several provider discovery and skill catalog edge cases around missing native provider binaries, invalid provider responses, and provider-root normalization.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added Claude Fable 5 to the Claude and Cursor model surfaces, including the shared model contract, Cursor model variants, keybinding metadata, provider discovery invalidation, and focused model-picker coverage.
- Added Cursor ACP model discovery and refresh handling so Cursor-backed sessions can recover from stale, partial, or invalid model state more reliably.
- Added provider usage infrastructure for Codex, Claude, Cursor, and Gemini, including credential discovery, provider-specific parsers, shared display helpers, SQLite-backed snapshot caching, server RPC routes, and client snapshot normalization.
- Added provider usage UI in chat and settings: Environment panel usage rows, compact usage menu controls, progress tracks, line lists, limit rows, rate-limit opening helpers, and provider usage settings navigation.
- Added desktop backend Node option handling and tests, memory diagnostics, WebSocket stream backpressure guards, and provider runtime ingestion buffer coverage.
- Added centralized Windows desktop caption controls, top-bar gutter support, preload IPC wiring, and focused browser/unit coverage for sidebar, keybinding, composer, usage, and provider discovery paths.

### Changed

- Reworked the composer model/options picker flow so split pickers are used where they help, empty threads stay focused, and stacked composer panels share steadier sizing/content helpers.
- Refined Cursor provider integration around ACP capability checks, model support parsing, discovery refreshes, provider health, and adapter behavior.
- Unified provider usage display and pacing logic across server snapshots, shared helpers, React hooks, settings panels, and in-chat usage sections.
- Tightened Codex app-server recovery, backend memory limits, and streaming behavior so reconnects, partial streams, and live provider updates stay more predictable.
- Refined Windows desktop chrome to keep native-style controls in one fixed cluster and avoid custom titlebar paths outside Windows.
- Updated Linux download metadata to use the current `-x64` AppImage asset naming.

### Fixed

- Fixed plugin mention icons in sent user bubbles so selected plugin/file identity is preserved after sending.
- Fixed provider discovery invalidation so refreshed model lists can update the UI without stale model state lingering.
- Fixed usage parsing/display edge cases for provider-specific quota and pacing data.
- Fixed composer stacked panel sizing, queued/live-change header alignment, and trait-picker behavior around compact controls.
- Fixed sidebar/search palette state and route metadata edge cases covered by new tests.
- Fixed WebSocket backpressure and buffered provider-runtime ingestion cases that could otherwise leave live updates stale under load.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Added transcript text markers with orchestration events, projection persistence, migration `042_ProjectionThreadsMarkers`, shared marker validation, transcript selection actions, marker-aware scrolling, and an Environment panel marker section.
- Added website favicon support for markdown links, composer/user-bubble link chips, and bare-domain link parsing, backed by a server-side favicon cache and authenticated favicon image route.
- Added local server monitoring, project-run tracking, local-server Environment panel rows, sidebar/project-run controls, and WebSocket/RPC contracts for listing and stopping tracked dev servers.
- Added terminal/project visual identity helpers and project-run target/running helpers so local server and terminal surfaces can share clearer labels and icons.
- Added focused tests for marker round-trips, marker scrolling, local server monitoring, project run targets, terminal visual identity, favicon parsing/cache behavior, and link chip parsing.

### Changed

- Refined transcript rendering and timeline behavior so marker navigation, markdown highlights, collapsed work disclosures, and auto-scroll follow logic are less likely to fight each other.
- Unified link rendering across AI responses, composer chips, and sent user bubbles so site identity, favicon fallback, alignment, and medium-weight text stay consistent.
- Reworked local-server discovery around listener address-family metadata, project ownership matching, and tracked PTY/dev-server state.
- Refined recent view switching, browser panel identity, terminal chrome sizing, and local server display state around project-aware surfaces.
- Tightened orchestration projection and provider/runtime handling around markers, thread updates, local server state, and terminal/runtime cleanup.

### Fixed

- Fixed retired model picker keybindings so shortcuts keep working when hidden/retired model entries are present.
- Fixed collapsed work disclosures retriggering tail-scroll behavior after output had already settled.
- Fixed formatter drift in `apps/server/src/wsRpc.ts` and `apps/web/src/lib/serverReactQuery.ts`.
- Fixed the local-server test fixture to include the required listener address `family` field.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added macOS update artifact smoke tooling, zip finalization helpers, and boolean environment parsing tests for the desktop release path.
- Added focused diff panel components for the toolbar, file jump menu, file list, patch viewport, and selector helpers.
- Added browser/unit coverage for queued turn auto-dispatch, plan-mode queued chat turns, composer stacked panel framing, diff view-source logic, provider discovery, markdown rendering, and mention/file icon behavior.

### Changed

- Refreshed README/release messaging and Synara desktop update flow documentation around the current app positioning.
- Reworked the diff panel around explicit repo-vs-turn state, searchable file filtering, and smaller view components.
- Unified composer stacked panels above the input so plan activity, queued follow-ups, and live file-change rows share width, border, radius, and dark-mode opacity.
- Refined chat markdown spacing, composer command menu selection, provider/plugin discovery normalization, and file/plugin icon rendering in sent messages.

### Fixed

- Fixed queued chat dispatch so queued turns preserve their own interaction mode, attachments, and prompt while a plan follow-up is pending.
- Fixed live file-change composer chrome so it appears only for active turns with actual provider file edits.
- Fixed draft/reference handling so selected plugin and file mentions keep their structured references and icons after navigation or reload.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Added project, thread, and message pinning across the orchestration projection, persistence layer, shared pin helpers, sidebar state, environment panel, and focused web stores.
- Added environment-panel pinned-message management and autosaved thread notes so durable context can live beside the transcript without being mixed into the chat stream.
- Added a recent-view switcher with keyboard navigation, keycap hints, route activation logic, persistent recent-view tracking, and browser/unit coverage.
- Added resumable desktop update download infrastructure with dedicated tests for partial files, persisted metadata, retry behavior, and interrupted download recovery.
- Added pull-availability data to the Git contract/server/web path so Git action controls can reflect whether pull is actually safe and useful for the current branch.
- Added broader tests for keybindings, composer mentions, composer drafts, pinned projects/threads/messages, thread detail prewarming, recent views, migrations, and release browser flows.

### Changed

- Reworked the sidebar/project/thread pinning model around shared logic so pinned state is projected consistently after reloads, legacy migration reconciliation, and snapshot refreshes.
- Expanded the chat environment surface with dedicated pinned and notes sections, tighter environment row styling, and shared action hooks for pin/unpin flows.
- Tightened composer behavior around mention icons, draft references, queued headers, picker styling, compact controls, and empty-chat controls.
- Improved runtime resilience around external Claude shutdowns, terminal manager cleanup, websocket RPC error flow, and provider session recovery.
- Refined projection snapshot queries and pipeline behavior so pinned messages, notes, and project pins are present in thread detail and orchestration snapshots.
- Updated release/browser tests and mocks around the recent switcher, keybindings, and app release surfaces.

### Fixed

- Fixed pinned-state migrations and legacy reconciliation so older projected thread data can upgrade cleanly.
- Fixed composer mention icon rendering and draft reference handling.
- Fixed release browser tests by adding switcher keycap coverage and the needed test mock.
- Fixed Git action availability checks that previously had to infer pull state too late in the UI.
- Fixed external Claude SIGTERM handling so an outside shutdown is treated as a benign suspended session instead of a failed turn.

### Verification

- Added richer agent activity detail surfaces so subagent/task rows can be opened and inspected from the transcript flow.
- Added release notes for `0.1.3` to the built-in What's New / Release History data.

### Changed

- Reworked transcript, chat header, environment panel, Git action, branch toolbar, and queued composer rendering so busy sessions remain easier to scan.
- Computed repo diff totals once in `ChatView` and reused them across the header and environment panel, avoiding duplicate large-patch parsing during live updates.
- Streamlined archived-thread deletion through shared client helpers, including optimistic local removal, batched worktree-linked cleanup, and a single shell snapshot reconciliation.
- Made desktop update UI quieter during background polling and kept production web/server/desktop sourcemaps disabled by default unless explicitly enabled for diagnostics.
- Tightened terminal runtime cleanup, shell summary handling, provider activity ingestion, and session handoff safeguards.
- Refined composer attachment, reference chip, queued row, and compact control spacing for a cleaner release build.

### Fixed

- Fixed TypeScript exact-optional-property failures in optional callback pass-throughs.
- Fixed recap generation test doubles to use the shared `ThreadRecapGenerationInput` contract.
- Updated image attachment chip tests to match the current compact thumbnail UI.
